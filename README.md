🚀 Fraud Detection System

📌 Description

This project implements a fraud detection system using a dataset like the Credit Card Fraud Dataset. It trains a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The system includes:

🔍 Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, standardizing features, and addressing class imbalance using SMOTE.

🤖 Model Training: Training a Random Forest Classifier.

📊 Model Evaluation: Computing precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

🖥️ Testing Interface: A command-line interface (CLI) for manual transaction input and an automated test case.

🛠️ Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📊 Pandas & NumPy

🧠 Scikit-learn

⚖️ Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
